# ARK-Game-Save
Windows batch scripts to save and restore your ARK Survival Ascended game (Island map, initially)

I'll eventually add/change code so this will work with other map files.

I also plan on creating a YouTube video to walk through how to use it.

Steps to use these files:
1. On the right side, click on the latest entry under "Releases".
2. Under Assets, click on the "Source.zip" entry to download the code package.
3. Open Windows File Explorer application.
4. Click on "Downloads" in the left navigation pane.
5. You should have an "ARK-Game-Save" entry zip file (which will also include the version number in the name)
6. Select (single click) this zip file and choose the "Entract All" option on the top menu bar.
7. Delete the default destination folder entry and paste this in its place:
   C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\ARK Survival Ascended\ShooterGame\Saved\SavedArksLocal
9. This will open up the default ARK save directory on your machine, and you should see the "ARK-Game-Save" entry (which will include a version number).
10. Double click on that entry to go into it.
11. <still working on this>
12. In the left navigation pane, click on the "C:" drive entry
13. Double click "Program Files (x86)".
14. Double click "steamapps".
15. Double click "common".
16. 
Backup.bat
1. Open up Steam and go to the "LIBRARY" tab.
2. Right mouse click on your ARK Survival Ascended game entry and select "Properties"
3. Select the "Installed Files" item in the menu.
4. Click on the "Browse..." button to the right of the file size information. (this will open up Windows File Explorer view of the folder/directory)
5. Go into the "ShooterGame" folder by double clicking it.
6. Go into the "Saved" folder by double clicking it.
7. Right mouse click on "SavedArksLocal" folder and click on "Pin to Quick Access" (you should see a "SavedArksLocal" entry in the left navigation area)
8. Go into the "SavedArksLocal" folder by double clicking it.
9. On the top menu bar, click on the "+New" drop down and select "Text Document".
10. Hit the Delete key to remove the "New Text Document" words AND the ".txt" entry.
11. Type in Backup.bat (and hit ENTER). The system should prompt you about making sure that you want to change the file name extension, click "Yes" to confirm.
12. Right mouse click on the "Backup.bat" file that you just created and select "Edit in Notepad".
13. Open up the "Backup.bat" file (maybe best to open this in another tab so you can keep this readme open)
